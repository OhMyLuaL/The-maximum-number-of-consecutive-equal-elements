TASK
Arrays and dynamic memory cannot be used in the tasks of this leaflet - only variables! The input data (except for one task) must be read before the number 0 appears, which means the end of the sequence. The number 0 itself is not considered a sequence element and does not need to be processed.
Given a sequence of natural numbers, ending with the number 0. Determine what is the largest number of consecutive elements of this sequence are equal to each other.

Numbers following 0 do not need to be read.
Input data
You are given a sequence of natural numbers ending with the number 0.

Output
